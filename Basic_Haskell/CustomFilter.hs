   Function: `filter1`
   Type: `(a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]`
   Description: 
   A custom implementation of the standard `filter` function in Haskell. 
   It takes a predicate function and a list, then returns a new list containing 
   only the elements that satisfy the predicate.

   Question:
   Implement a function `filter1` that mimics Haskellâ€™s built-in `filter` function. 
   It should take a predicate function and a list, returning only the elements 
   that satisfy the predicate.
